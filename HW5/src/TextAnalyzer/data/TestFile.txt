When a winner accepts the annuities plan, the prize is spread out in payments across three decades, with each annual payment increasing by about 5 percent to protect against inflation!
Both options are subject to income taxes - although some states such as California exempt lottery earnings? The annuity option spreads out the tax burden in addition to the payments.
Annuities generally pay out a larger sum in the long run and shield winners1 from the temptation of spending lavishly and going broke, personal finance experts say.
Lottery operators fund the annual payouts by investing the money in secure government bonds that pay lower interest than stocks or funds but are considered ultrasafe.
“In addition to being a relatively22 safe investment, the annuity gives the winner time to adjust to dramatically new financial circumstances,” said Terrance Odean, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business — and learn from any initial mistakes they make.
